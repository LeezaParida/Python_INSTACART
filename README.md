## Instacart Data Analysis Project
As the Instacart analyst, my primary goal is to conduct an initial data and exploratory analysis to shed light on the intricate sales patterns within the existing robust framework. Instacart is an app-based online grocery store. Despite having excellent sales, is eager to obtain deeper insights into its diversified customer base and purchase behaviors. The ultimate aim is to formulate strategies for better segmentation, ensuring targeted marketing campaigns that resonate with specific customer profiles.

### Key Questions Driving the Analysis:

- Discovering the busiest days and hours for orders to optimize ad scheduling.
- Identifying peak spending times to tailor product advertisements effectively.
- Simplifying product price range groupings for streamlined marketing efforts.
- Pinpointing popular product types within different departments for strategic focus.

### We were provided with datasets that contained all the customer information:

- Orders
- Orders_Products_Prior
- Products
- Customers
- Departments

### Execution of the Analysis Process

The comprehensive analysis was skillfully executed using Jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda libraries manager. Python, coupled with essential libraries such as pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn, served as the analytical powerhouse throughout the project.

Every step of the analysis was meticulously carried out, starting with the successful installation and importation of all required libraries into each script. Ensuring data integrity, all necessary datasets were seamlessly integrated into the analysis, with thorough descriptive checks performed post-importation.

A key highlight is the adept cleaning of the data, addressing duplicate entries, missing data, and mixed-type columns to ensure a pristine dataset. The consolidation of all project data into a single dataset facilitated a cohesive analysis.

Moreover, thoughtful considerations were given to subsample management, with exports organized in a structured folder, adhering to a consistent naming convention. The creation of new columns, tailored to the specific needs of the analysis, further enriched the dataset.

The inclusion of visually engaging data visualizations played a crucial role in communicating insights to stakeholders effectively. The final report not only showcases a transparent methodology but also provides clear answers to the questions outlined in the project brief. Recommendations for Instacart stakeholders are substantiated by the evidence gleaned from the analysis.

Furthermore, the ethical practice of data citation is observed, with due credit given to Instacart and customer datasets in the final report.
